# Expo Android Build Error

This repository demonstrates a problem with Expo Android builds where the build process fails with a generic error message.  The project compiles and runs successfully on iOS, but building the Android APK fails. The error message provides little insight into the root cause.  The solution explores various approaches to troubleshooting this type of error, including checking dependencies, cleaning the project, and validating the Android environment setup.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Try to build the Android APK using `expo build:android`.

**Expected Result:**
A successful Android APK build.

**Actual Result:**
The build fails with a vague error message (see error logs in the console).
