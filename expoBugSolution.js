The solution often involves carefully checking the Android project configuration and dependencies.  One approach is to eject the project from Expo, but this is an extreme step. Instead, ensure that the Android SDK, NDK, and build tools are correctly installed and configured.  Pay close attention to any warnings or errors during the build process (they might be hidden within a larger error message), especially those related to dependencies. Sometimes the issue is related to a specific dependency that conflicts with others. Try creating a minimal reproduction project to isolate the root cause. If it still doesn't work, carefully check all your Expo config files (app.json and app.config.js) for errors, missing information, or invalid configurations.
