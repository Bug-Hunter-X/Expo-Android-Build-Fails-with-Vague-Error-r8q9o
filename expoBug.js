This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK.  The error message is vague, often mentioning a problem with the Android build system or a missing dependency, but without specifics. The project builds fine on iOS, and there's no indication of any issues in the Android project files itself. Cleaning and rebuilding the project doesn't help, neither does updating Expo CLI or Android SDK tools.
